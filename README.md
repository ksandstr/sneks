What
====

This is `sneks', an experimental operating system for the x86 architecture
built on a L4.X2 microkernel. The goal is to develop a POSIX-compatible set of
operating system services so as to eventually run most of the GNU userspace.

`sneks' is licensed under the GNU GPL version 2 or, at your convenience, a
later version published by the FSF. A copy of GPLv2 is found in the COPYING
file in this directory.


How?

Beats me, it's way under development.
